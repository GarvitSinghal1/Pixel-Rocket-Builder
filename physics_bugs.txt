### PHYSICAL ENGINE AUDIT REPORT ###
Project: Pixel Rocket Builder
Status: ANNOYINGLY THOROUGH

--- PHYSICS BUGS ---

1. [CRITICAL] ISP/Thrust Scaling Paradox
   Location: js/physics.js (consumeFuelAndGetThrust)
   Bug: The simulation calculates mass flow (consumptionRate) using current ISP but then scales thrust separately. 
   Effect: As the rocket enters vacuum, its fuel consumption rate DECREASES while thrust INCREASES. 
   Reality: Rocket engines have a fixed mass flow (set by pumps); thrust increases in vacuum because exhaust velocity increases. 
   Annoyance level: High. Your rockets are getting "free" fuel efficiency in space.

2. [MAJOR] G-Force Vector Ignorance
   Location: js/physics.js (line 1353)
   Bug: G-force is calculated as: (|Thrust| + |Drag|) / Mass / G0.
   Effect: It adds magnitudes regardless of direction. If a rocket is decelerating (re-entry), Drag and Thrust might oppose or align, but they shouldn't just be summed as absolute scalars. 
   Reality: G-force is the magnitude of the vector sum of all non-gravitational forces.
   Annoyance level: Medium. Telemetry is lying to the pilot about structural stress.

3. [MAJOR] Cross-Sectional Area Underestimation
   Location: js/physics.js (calculateDrag)
   Bug: maxWidth is calculated as Math.max(maxWidth, partDef.width) across ALL parts.
   Effect: For a rocket with side-boosters (e.g., Falcon Heavy style), it only calculates the area of the single widest stack. 
   Reality: Projected frontal area should be the sum of all stacks perpendicular to the flow. 
   Annoyance level: Medium. Wide rockets have significantly less drag than they should.

4. [MINOR] Delta-V Display Inaccuracy
   Location: js/physics.js (calculateDeltaV)
   Bug: Uses total fuel capacity (calculateTotalFuel) instead of current fuel (calculateCurrentFuel) for Delta-V.
   Effect: The Delta-V metric doesn't decrease as fuel is consumed during flight.
   Annoyance level: Low but irritating.

5. [MINOR] Arbitrary Speed of Sound in Vacuum
   Location: js/planets.js (getPlanetAtmosphere)
   Bug: Returns 273 m/s as a "safe" speed of sound for Mach calculations in vacuum.
   Effect: Mach number is still reported in vacuum, which is physically meaningless.
   Annoyance level: Low.

6. [MINOR] TWR Surface Constraint
   Location: js/physics.js (calculateTWR)
   Bug: Always scales weight by surfaceGravity of the planet.
   Effect: TWR doesn't increase as the rocket gains altitude and gravity weakens.
   Annoyance level: Minimal.

--- HTML / UI BUGS ---

1. [BROKEN] Missing Main Script
   Location: index.html (line 122)
   Bug: <script src="js/script.js"></script> references a file that does not exist in the repository.
   
2. [UI] Inconsistent Link Styling
   Location: index.html (line 25)
   Bug: The "LAUNCH GAME" link has a hardcoded inline style for color instead of using a CSS class.

3. [TYPO] Documentation Typo
   Location: js/parts.js (line 485)
   Bug: "habitation_module" description contains "habitaiton".

4. [UI] Telemetry Z-Index
   Location: css/styles.css (line 446)
   Bug: Potential for overlays to block controls if not carefully managed (though currently mitigated by z-index: 200).

--- SUMMARY ---
The physics engine is "educational-grade" but suffers from basic vector math errors and non-conservative mass-flow logic. Fix the ISP scaling first if you want any semblance of realism.
