PIXEL ROCKET BUILDER - COMPREHENSIVE PHYSICS & LOGIC AUDIT
========================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CRITICAL PHYSICS BUGS]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gravity Constant Inconsistency (physics.js vs planets.js)
   - Description: physics.js uses 9.8 or 9.81 in various local functions, while planets.js defines Earth surface gravity as 9.80665. 
   - Impact: Slight errors in TWR and Delta-V telemetry.

2. Cross-Stage Fuel Draining (physics.js)
   - Description: The engine logic gathers ALL connected fuel tanks and drains them equally. It does NOT check if a tank is separated by a decoupler.
   - Impact: Engines drain fuel from upper stages prematurely, effectively giving first-stage engines access to the entire rocket's fuel pool.

3. 1D Orbital Projection / "Fake" Orbit (advanced.js)
   - Description: The simulation projects 1D vertical altitude/velocity into a 2D state vector assuming zero horizontal velocity. 
   - Impact: It is impossible to achieve a stable circular orbit; the rocket is always on a purely radial trajectory. Orbital elements like Eccentricity and True Anomaly are mathematically "pinned" to a radial plunge.

4. False RK4 Integration (physics.js)
   - Description: The code comments claim "RK4-like integration sub-stepping". ACTUAL: The code uses standard first-order Euler integration.
   - Impact: Higher inaccuracy in trajectory calculation at high speeds or low framerates.

5. Missing ISP/Altitude Scaling (physics.js / advanced.js)
   - Description: The physics engine does NOT adjust thrust or ISP based on altitude. Engines produce 100% thrust from sea level to vacuum.
   - Impact: Unrealistic performance profile throughout ascent.

[INTEGRATION & LOGIC BUGS]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Disconnected Advanced Physics Modules (advanced.js)
   - Description: `attemptIgnition`, `checkCavitation`, and `updateThrottleWithLag` are implemented but NEVER CALLED in the main `physicsStep` loop.
   - Impact: Advanced mode features are purely cosmetic or non-functional.

7. Auto-Build Decoupler Shift Bug (editor.js)
   - Description: Auto-decoupler shifts ALL parts with Y > engineBottom further down. 
   - Impact: Side boosters or radially attached parts lower than a central engine are shifted, breaking their side-attachments.

8. Staging Mechanics - Missing Physical Separation (physics.js)
   - Description: `triggerStage` acts as a simple index switch. Actual physical separation (velocity impulse, decoupler force) is missing. Parts just "disappear" from the active list.

9. Global Fuel Pool Logic (physics.js)
   - Description: `calculateTotalFuel` sums capacity of ALL placed tanks. No fuel flow logic or tank connectivity exists.
   - Impact: Prevents realistic stage-based fuel management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[UI & UX BUGS]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Advanced Telemetry Overflow (simulator.html)
    - Description: Advanced mode adds 9+ rows of labels. On small screens, the telemetry panel overflows the flight controls.
    - Impact: Critical flight controls can be obscured.

11. G-Force Indicator Saturation (main.js)
    - Description: The G-indicator caps at 100% for 10G. 
    - Impact: Fails to visualize the severity of structural-failure-level G-forces (e.g., 50G+).

12. Disconnected Part Warning Threshold (validation.js)
    - [FIXED]: Resolved by renaming `getConnectedParts` -> `getLaunchableParts` and adding strict BFS seed logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[PLACEHOLDERS & UNUSED FEATURES]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Planet Visuals Placeholder: Sky color and atmosphere don't update visually when changing planets.
14. Unused Orbital Elements: True Anomaly, Inclination, etc., are calculated but never displayed or used.
15. Debris Physics: It is a purely visual effect in `main.js` and does not follow the core physics engine.
